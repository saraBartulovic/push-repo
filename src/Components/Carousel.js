Death is a mere inconvenience for Zagreus, returning to Hades' palace each time to reflect in the Mirror of Night and try again. Receive Boons from the other gods of Olympus and find treasures to aid in each escape attempt.",

He is mostly faced with various aggressive shades working for his father, but he also has run-ins with the Furies, the skeletal remains of the Lernaean Hydra, and the champion of Elysium, in order to arrive at the Temple of Styx."
